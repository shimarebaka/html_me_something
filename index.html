        <h5>By Rebaka Mazumder</h5>
        <p style="font-family:Times New Roman;">In 2015, my family and I took a vacation to Destin Florida.Throughout my time spent there, I got to see many beautiful sights. It was a a very fun experience and I made some great memories as well. The beaches at Destin were remarkably beautiful and majestic with the ocean expanding seeemigly endlessly. </p>

        <p>We stayed in a beautiful hotel room and it was absolutely stunning. My daughter especially loved the view of the ocean from the hotel. She and I had a lot of fun together on the trip and bonded immensely. I also had the opportunity to take a good amount of pictures with my daughter, marking some of the greatest highlights of her childhood.</p>

        <P>While staying in Destin, we also visited many places including restaurants, shopping locations, and sight seeing areas. Many of these places were very interesting.The food at the restaurants that we ate at was very delicious as well. There seemed to be an endless amount of things to do while were in Destin.</p>

        <p>Overall, it was an amazing getaway and I loved my trip to Destin. I got to enjoy a lot of different foods and novelites during my stay which I wouldn't have been able to experience anywhere else. My experience is only native to Destin and its beautiful shores </p>
